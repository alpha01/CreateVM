CreateVM
==========

Create virtual machine instances the easy way.

Opted not to use Vagrant and overly complicated things. Then decided their should be an easy way to create virtual envinroments in my systems, good stuff.

Hypervisors targeted:
 - KVM-QEMU
 - VirtualBox
 - Xen
 - Solaris Zones (not really a hypervisor, but similar)


Eventually planning on adding support for:
 - FreeBSD - BHyVe
 - FreeBSD - Jails (not really a hypervisor, but similar)
