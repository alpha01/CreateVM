CreateVM
==========

Create virtual machine instances the easy way.

This is how I create new guest VMs in my homelab, good stuff.

Hypervisors targeted:
 - KVM-QEMU
 - VirtualBox
 - Xen
 - LXC (Containers)
 - Solaris Zones (Containers)


Eventually planning on adding support for:
 - FreeBSD - BHyVe
 - FreeBSD - Jails (not really a hypervisor, but similar)
